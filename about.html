            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hey! My name is Icarus, and I was raised on the west coast of California. I live in the central valley
                currently. I'm currently looking into a career in anthropology despite the niche-ness of the subject.
                I'm a long-term Final Fantasy nerd, and I'm into a few other JRPGs also. Front-end design isn't in my
                usual set of interests, and I found my way into it through sheer curiosity of what it's like in the
                industry!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Interested?</h2>
            <p>I'm flattered.</p>

                    I've attended Clovis East High School since my first year in high school, but I also began attending
                    the Center for Advanced Research and Technology during my third year. During this time, I've taken
                    AP Psychology, Web Applications, and Honors English 11.

                <div></div>
                <p>
                    I plan to major in anthropology. I'll most likely minor in something related like linguistics. I
                    hope
                    to eventually work up to a masters!
                </p>

                    During my second year of high school, I became the social media manager of my high school's GSA
                    club. When I held this position, it was my responsibility to brainstorm ideas for events, plan them,
                    volunteer at them, and manage our presence online. I also participated in the Web Applications class
                    provided at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology during my third year. This class has
                    taught me to effectively use HTML, CSS, Github, and a basic amount of JS. On a less professional
                    level, I've also taken art and design commissions for close friends of mine.

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <div></div>
            <p>Subject-wise, I find a majority of my interest within social behaviour. I've taken AP Psychology and done
                extensive research into personality disorders, and I also enjoy learning about cultural history. If
                we're talking video games (and honestly, when is anyone in the front-end design community not talking
                about video games) I'm unhealthily interested in later-era Final Fantasy games. I also enjoy Gravity
                Rush 1 & 2 and Nier: Automata. When I need to get out of my room, I take pride in my amateur
                rock-climbing and rollerblading skills!</p>
