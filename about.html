                <p>
                    Hey! My name is Icarus, and I'm currently based in the Californian central valley. I was brought up
                    in a small town north of LA, but otherwise haven't been around much. My sights are set on joining a
                    career in the field of history or anthropology! I found my way into front-end design through sheer
                    curiosity of the subject, and I just happened to be lucky enough to have access to an amazing
                    program offered in collaboration with my local high school. Besides goals and plans and all that fun
                    stuff, I'm also a huge nerd. I'm super into new-age Final Fantasy games (specifically the Nova
                    Crysallis trilogy), other assorted JRPGs (Gravity Rush, NiER: Automata), animanga, and DC's Batman
                    branch. I grew up surrounded by Japanese media since my parents had me soon after moving back to the
                    U.S. from three years abroad there, so it's a huge part of my current lifestyle. Outside of my usual
                    geeking I also enjoy a good read, and I also partake in indoor rock-climbing!

                        I've attended Clovis East High School since my first year in high school, but I also began
                        attending
                        the Center for Advanced Research and Technology during my third year. During this time, I've
                        taken
                        AP Psychology, Web Applications, and Honors English 11.

                        I plan to major in anthropology. I'll most likely minor in something related like linguistics. I
                        hope
                        to eventually work up to a masters!

                    <p>
                        During my second year of high school, I became the social media manager of my high school's GSA
                        club. When I held this position, it was my responsibility to brainstorm ideas for events, plan
                        them,
                        volunteer at them, and manage our presence online. I also participated in the Web Applications
                        class
                        provided at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology during my third year. This class has
                        taught me to effectively use HTML, CSS, Github, and a basic amount of JS. On a less professional
                        level, I've also taken art and design commissions for close friends of mine.

                    Subject-wise, I've been in love with learning about clinical psychology ever since 7th grade. I
                    especially take interest in personality and dissociative disorders. I used to be a big space geek,
                    but I'm not incredibly devoted to that now (my favorite kind of star is a neutron star, Pluto is a
                    planet because I say so, and Io is my favorite moon, if you were wondering). I'm also incredibly
                    fascinated by photography and cinematography, especially moody environments like Blade Runner 2077
                    and Wes Anderson/Wong Kar-wai styles of color grading. I've looked into a lot of career paths
                    revolving these subjects, but in the end I want to find myself in a field where I can help connect
                    people, no matter what I end up pursuing.
