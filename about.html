                <p>
                    Hey! My name is Icarus, and I'm currently based in the Californian central valley. I was brought up in a small town north of LA, but otherwise haven't been around much. My sights are set on joining a career in the field of history or anthropology! I found my way into front-end design through sheer curiosity of the subject, and I just happened to be lucky enough to have access to an amazing program offered in collaboration with my local high school. Besides goals and plans and all that fun stuff, I'm also a huge nerd. I'm super into new-age Final Fantasy games (specifically the Nova Crysallis trilogy), other assorted JRPGs (Gravity Rush, NiER: Automata), animanga, and DC's Batman branch. I grew up surrounded by Japanese media since my parents had me soon after moving back to the U.S. from three years abroad there, so it's a huge part of my current lifestyle. Outside of my usual geeking I also enjoy a good read, and I also partake in indoor rock-climbing!

                        I've attended Clovis East High School since my first year in high school, but I also began
                        attending
                        the Center for Advanced Research and Technology during my third year. During this time, I've
                        taken
                        AP Psychology, Web Applications, and Honors English 11.

                    <p>
                        I plan to major in anthropology. I'll most likely minor in something related like linguistics. I
                        hope
                        to eventually work up to a masters!

                        During my second year of high school, I became the social media manager of my high school's GSA
                        club. When I held this position, it was my responsibility to brainstorm ideas for events, plan
                        them,
                        volunteer at them, and manage our presence online. I also participated in the Web Applications
                        class
                        provided at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology during my third year. This class has
                        taught me to effectively use HTML, CSS, Github, and a basic amount of JS. On a less professional
                        level, I've also taken art and design commissions for close friends of mine.

            <p>
                Subject-wise, I find a majority of my interest within social behaviour. I've taken AP Psychology and
                done
                extensive research into personality disorders, and I also enjoy learning about cultural history. If
                we're talking video games (and honestly, when is anyone in the front-end design community not
                talking
                about video games) I'm unhealthily interested in later-era Final Fantasy games. I also enjoy Gravity
                Rush 1 & 2 and Nier: Automata. When I need to get out of my room, I take pride in my amateur
                rock-climbing and rollerblading skills!
