                        Halo Veare. Veare began this project to address his religious trauma and the journey it takes to
                        escape the only life you've known all along. My closeness to him allowed me to take the honour
                        of adding my own touches to his project and developing the antagonists as well as their society.

            <div></div>

            <p>
                Vague is a young man whose society had taught him to destroy an alien species in fear they would
                overtake human society. As long as he'd lived, he'd never found reason to question their opinions. It
                changed one day when he came across a member of the species he'd been meant to kill. Unlike the usual
                violent reaction he'd witnessed, the person instead begged him for help. Vague found himself curious.
                Over time, Vague befriends Descent—the person he assisted. Descent takes refuge hidden in Vague's house,
                and the two of them slowly uncover violent secrets their societies had been hiding from them. The two of
                them don't find peace in this, however. While Vague is already grappling with the knowledge he's
                learning from Descent, a band of radicals is trying to recruit him as well. Time is quickly running out
                as Vague tries to decide which side to take.

            <div></div>

            <p>
                Allegories takes a more earthy approach to design. The primary setting is a town deep within a
                grassland. Right now, my designs need to be revamped and redone more cohesively in terms of the
                environment and resources. The designs presented are the version 1 designs, which were created before a
                majority of the story was created.

                    <h4>Shiem</h4>
                    <p>
                        Shiem's original design followed a more traditionally alternative aesthetic. In his updated
                        design, I wanted his clothes to be more visibly similar to Tea's, who makes them. Shiem is meant
                        to stand out from other characters in terms of seeming a lot more sure of himself. His clothes
                        are overall brighter and more accessorised to try and convey this. While other characters are
                        internally confident, I wanted a character who looks confident even though they're not. His
                        iridescent shirt beneath the jacket also reflects his place in the story: One of the most
                        reliable members of Vague's society (in his age group), secretly hiding a relationship with an
                        alien underneath.

                    <h4>Costa</h4>
                    <p>
                        Costa revolves around neutrals, greens, and overall outfits which make him easy to pass over.
                        His outfits provide internal pockets and loose shapes for him to hide supplies in, but also
                        reflect his little sense of self. He's not expected to stand out, so he doesn't, even though
                        he's incredibly skilled—that's what I needed his design to portray.

                    <p>
                        Nox's outfit and overall design is incredibly detailed, but nonsensical. Their original design
                        was based on webcore and tenshi kaiwai aesthetics, but later was changed to a more traditionally
                        cyberpunk aesthetic. Their current outfit reflects aspects of the original designs, but was
                        changed to reflect the available resources and dyes in their environment. I kept the blues and
                        pops of colour, as well as the cutouts and purification mask (which was optimised and given to
                        everyone else as well). They still stand out, and are meant to look odd compared to everyone
                        else, so I'm happy with their current design.

                Allegories in total typically has a mix of pale, desaturated colours paired with extremely oversaturated
                ones.
                The colour palette shares the same fight as the characters do; most people are meant to have some very
                contradictory colours to represent that. Others who have very little sense of self and feel like they're
                getting swept away in the battle (such as Costa and Vague) display little contrast. The art I provide
                doesn't match the usual theme, because the characters I draw are usually a part of climatic elements of
                the story. In turn, most of my associated art with Allegories is heavily oversaturated. Alongside this,
                I make sure to add a prevailing theme of overshadowing darkness in the palette.

            <p>
                Nox's transition from webcore to cyberpunk was a big one. I knew that I wanted Nox to have a bigger
                presence, which is why I changed their more tame initial design. Nox's main focus is on catching
                attention and being the most eye-catching person in their environment, and that lead to me designing an
                overall dark outfit with bright highlights. I decided to keep a similar idea by having bright pops of
                yellow and other colours in their revised outfit. I also wanted to properly portray their inability to
                dress cohesively, which I decided to cover by adding unusual layering and color combinations.

            <p>
                Iocom's design was a hard project to overcome. I had originally wanted him to have strong ethnic
                features, leading me to heavily reference some traits found in Masatoshi Hamada's face (a popular
                Japanese comedian whom I grew up watching). However, I ended up overgeneralizing these features and
                creating a design I was very unsatisfied with. I knew for a fact I didn't want him to look like a
                stereotypical Chinese mob boss, since depictions of that nature are inherently incredibly racist. I had
                initially wanted his child, Nox, to have two Chinese parents. However after this design, I settled on
                having two heavily mixed parents with prevailing Chinese ancestry. I then played with this to create a
                mixed white/asian design for Iocom. I absolutely hated this. He didn't represent his POC culture enough
                in this design, and he was also far too red-based for my liking. Later, I revisited him and decided to
                combine the features I enjoyed from both drawings. I wanted to keep a more diamond-shaped face seen in
                his initial design, and I also liked the bob-like hair seen in his second design. I wanted him to appear
                softer, but still commanding. His second hair style was very dear to me, but I didn't like how it framed
                his face, so I decided to add in braids. From there, I decided to add in more AAPI traits. Overall, he
                ended up with mixed Chinese/Hawaiian/Greek heritage. I'm very happy with his current design.

            <h3 id="allTakeaways">Things I've Learnt</h3>

            <p>
                As I've contributed to Allegories, I've learnt how having small things that set some characters apart
                from others is important. The difference between colours on a simple outfit can change the entire
                portrayal of a character. I've also learnt how to translate character traits from one style to another.
                My work on this project paved the road of my lineart's maturation, but with that comes the need to
                adjust initial designs to a new style. I particularly saw this problem with Jhim, who had overly
                stylised eyes. Overall, this project was very important to my development of lineart and understanding
                of cohesive character/environment design.

                    Worldbuilding of this project made me think about resource trade and government relations for the
