                            Allegories itself isn't my project—I am actually a collaborator alongside the actual
                            creator:
                            Halo Veare. Veare began this project to address his religious trauma and the journey it
                            takes to
                            escape the only life you've known all along. My closeness to him allowed me to take the
                            honour
                            of adding my own touches to his project and developing the antagonists as well as their
                            society.

                    Vague is a young man whose society had taught him to destroy an alien species in fear they would
                    overtake human society. As long as he'd lived, he'd never found reason to question their opinions.
                    It
                    changed one day when he came across a member of the species he'd been meant to kill. Unlike the
                    usual
                    violent reaction he'd witnessed, the person instead begged him for help. Vague found himself
                    curious.
                    Over time, Vague befriends Descent—the person he assisted. Descent takes refuge hidden in Vague's
                    house,
                    and the two of them slowly uncover violent secrets their societies had been hiding from them. The
                    two of
                    them don't find peace in this, however. While Vague is already grappling with the knowledge he's
                    learning from Descent, a band of radicals is trying to recruit him as well. Time is quickly running
                    out
                    as Vague tries to decide which side to take.

                    Allegories takes a more earthy approach to design. The primary setting is a town deep within a
                    grassland. The designs reflect this with homemade materials, imperfections in patterning, and
                    uniqueness. All the clothing worn is handmade, so I had full creative freedom to make the clothes as
                    factory impractical as I wanted. These also needed to be mostly functional. The amount of needed
                    functionality varies by how likely the character is to wear it to work, which also allowed me to
                    create
                    some more performative outfits as well as those meant for heavy wear-and-tear!

                        <h4>Shiem</h4>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Shiem's original design followed a more traditionally alternative aesthetic. In his updated
                            design, I wanted his clothes to be more visibly similar to Tea's, who makes them. Shiem is
                            meant
                            to stand out from other characters in terms of seeming a lot more sure of himself. His
                            clothes
                            are overall brighter and more accessorised to try and convey this. While other characters
                            are
                            internally confident, I wanted a character who looks confident even though they're not. His
                            iridescent shirt beneath the jacket also reflects his place in the story: One of the most
                            reliable members of Vague's society (in his age group), secretly hiding a relationship with
                            an
                            alien underneath.

                        <p>
                            Costa revolves around neutrals, greens, and overall outfits which make him easy to pass
                            over.
                            His outfits provide internal pockets and loose shapes for him to hide supplies in, but also
                            reflect his little sense of self. He's not expected to stand out, so he doesn't, even though
                            he's incredibly skilled—that's what I needed his design to portray.

                        <p>
                            Nox's outfit and overall design is incredibly detailed, but nonsensical. Their original
                            design
                            was based on webcore and tenshi kaiwai aesthetics, but later was changed to a more
                            traditionally
                            cyberpunk aesthetic. Their current outfit reflects aspects of the original designs, but was
                            changed to reflect the available resources and dyes in their environment. I kept the blues
                            and
                            pops of colour, as well as the cutouts and purification mask (which was optimised and given
                            to
                            everyone else as well). They still stand out, and are meant to look odd compared to everyone
                            else, so I'm happy with their current design.

                    Allegories in total typically has a mix of pale, desaturated colours paired with extremely
                    oversaturated
                    ones.
                    The colour palette shares the same fight as the characters do; most people are meant to have some
                    very
                    contradictory colours to represent that. Others who have very little sense of self and feel like
                    they're
                    getting swept away in the battle (such as Costa and Vague) display little contrast. The art I
                    provide
                    doesn't match the usual theme, because the characters I draw are usually a part of climatic elements
                    of
                    the story. In turn, most of my associated art with Allegories is heavily oversaturated. Alongside
                    this,
                    I make sure to add a prevailing theme of overshadowing darkness in the palette.

                    Nox's transition from webcore to cyberpunk was a big one. I knew that I wanted Nox to have a bigger
                    presence, which is why I changed their more tame initial design. Nox's main focus is on catching
                    attention and being the most eye-catching person in their environment, and that lead to me designing
                    an
                    overall dark outfit with bright highlights. I decided to keep a similar idea by having bright pops
                    of
                    yellow and other colours in their revised outfit. I also wanted to properly portray their inability
                    to
                    dress cohesively, which I decided to cover by adding unusual layering and color combinations.

                    Iocom's design was a hard project to overcome. I had originally wanted him to have strong ethnic
                    features, leading me to heavily reference some traits found in Masatoshi Hamada's face (a popular
                    Japanese comedian whom I grew up watching). However, I ended up overgeneralizing these features and
                    creating a design I was very unsatisfied with. I knew for a fact I didn't want him to look like a
                    stereotypical Chinese mob boss, since depictions of that nature are inherently incredibly racist. I
                    had
                    initially wanted his child, Nox, to have two Chinese parents. However after this design, I settled
                    on
                    having two heavily mixed parents with prevailing Chinese ancestry. I then played with this to create
                    a
                    mixed white/asian design for Iocom. I absolutely hated this. He didn't represent his POC culture
                    enough
                    in this design, and he was also far too red-based for my liking. Later, I revisited him and decided
                    to
                    combine the features I enjoyed from both drawings. I wanted to keep a more diamond-shaped face seen
                    in
                    his initial design, and I also liked the bob-like hair seen in his second design. I wanted him to
                    appear
                    softer, but still commanding. His second hair style was very dear to me, but I didn't like how it
                    framed
                    his face, so I decided to add in braids. From there, I decided to add in more AAPI traits. Overall,
                    he
                    ended up with mixed Chinese/Hawaiian/Greek heritage. I'm very happy with his current design.

                <h3 id="allTakeaways">Things I've Learnt</h3>

                <br>

                <p>
                    As I've contributed to Allegories, I've learnt how having small things that set some characters
                    apart
                    from others is important. The difference between colours on a simple outfit can change the entire
                    portrayal of a character. I've also learnt how to translate character traits from one style to
                    another.
                    My work on this project paved the road of my lineart's maturation, but with that comes the need to
                    adjust initial designs to a new style. I particularly saw this problem with Jhim, who had overly
                    stylised eyes. Overall, this project was very important to my development of lineart and
                    understanding
                    of cohesive character/environment design.

                        Worldbuilding of this project made me think about resource trade and government relations for
                        the
                        first time, and was my first true introduction to total worldbuilding outside an amateur 3rd
