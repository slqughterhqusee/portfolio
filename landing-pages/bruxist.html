                        Bruxist began in my sophomore year history class. What had been just a single doodle soon
                        evolved into a full universe. This project expanded on a kind of story I'd wanted to see since I
                        was a child: A story with a protagonist who wasn't necessarily good, or redeemable. This concept
                        had been explored with a project I began in freshman year (titled AUTOPSY), but I ended up
                        abandoning it before it could really take shape. This came to form again with Bruxist.

                Bruxist follows a young man called Lenen as he seeks revenge amid the apocalypse. After Lenen's brother,
                Omen, held a ritual that shook the heavens in hopes to bring immortality upon the human race, the
                falling gods began to inhabit bodies of the dead. Lenen, who had been killed by Omen when he expressed
                distaste for the plan, managed to be inhabited by a benevolent god which reignited him instead of
                possessing him. He begrudgingly accumulates others in a similar predicament and uses their goodwill to
                propel him on his mission to either end the apocalypse or bring living hell to Omen's front door.

            <p>
                Bruxist takes place in a dim-lit, purple-toned city. However, the overall world holds many aesthetics.
                Both dreamy grass plains and oriental yellow-red shrines can be found beyond the dreary city. The
                characters themselves were made to look simple. For most characters, I was aiming for designs that look
                generally typical until further examined.

                    <p>
                        Omen was the first character I designed for Bruxist, and his design has changed the least from
                        the original creation. The goal was to create a design that very clearly showed some sort of
                        power, as well as defilement. Something sharp and unnatural. I achieved this through the styling
                        of hair as well eye colour, which contrast traditional friendly-looking elements of religious
                        figures. I line Omen in crimson red to add to the stylisation of that concept. I also added
                        piercings to display a superficial element to them, which matches their personality.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Meridian's design is inspired by flappers, '80s jazz bars, and everything flamboyantly vintage.
                        Their showmanship is directed by their occupation, which happens to be working at a showman-type
                        cocktail bar. Meridian is a bartender, so typically the lower half of their outfit doesn't get
                        much attention. I address this in my designs by making their upper half incredibly dramatic with
                        a more minimalistic pant style. Their occupation continues to affect their outfit as well; I try
                        to make sure that their sleeves are either tight or are able to slide back down their arm so as
                        to not get caught up in pouring.

                    <p>
                        Compared to other Bruxist characters, Pinball's design is painfully stereotypical. The purpose
                        of this is that his body itself is twisted and distorted, meaning to create a meaningful image
                        of his suffering beneath. While others tend to have a small scar or injury, Pinball is entirely
                        blacked out, as his character is meant to explore his own representation of self after trauma
                        rather than the others, whose character focus is the response to the external environment
                        afterwards.

            <p>
                Bruxist's palette mainly consists of purples, greens, and neutrals. The use of these colours was
                initially used to display a more cyberpunk aesthetic, but as Bruxist got further into development, the
                less futuristic the city they inhabited became. The colours stayed however, and now have a less
                superficial meaning. The intensity of purple overlays is now representative of the worsening of Lenen's
                mental state. As Lenen spirals, the world becomes more and more distorted. This is another addition of
                many I've made showing that the people, and even the world itself, the viewer is shown isn't true to
                reality. Bruxist's character portrayal is directly affected by how each person views themself and the
                world around them.

            <p>
                X's original design was meant to represent a kind of stylised straightjacket. They were meant to look
                cunning, but hidden. As other characters developed in Bruxist, I eventually felt like they were starting
                to feel lackluster compared to some of the other designs. As I went in to redesign them, I knew I didn't
                want to make them over-elaborate, but rather more unique. Initially, I was planning to do a complete
                character overhaul and change them into some kind of robot. As I was trying to decide on a design for
                this, however, I really felt like I couldn't capture their charisma into something so expressionless.
                Instead, I took heavy inspiration from Junji Ito's <em>Tomoe</em>. Since they are three gods in one
                body, I added two extra heads. The hair was also meant to be cohesive in total, but messy up close.
                They're supposed to appear as beautiful at first glance, but the longer they're analysed, the more
                visible it is that something's terribly wrong. I also changed their main outfit. While they'll
                originally be found in a straightjacket, I also recalled a theory that two-headed mammals might have
                trouble regulating body-heat, which may be a factor in their death. With this in consideration, I made
                the choice that X will likely wear lots of winter clothes and fur coats.

            <h3 id="bruxTakeaways">Things I've Learnt</h3>

            <p>
                While working on Bruxist, I've learnt how the simplest additions to expression or design can change the
                entire portrayal of a character. For example, changing a traditionally sleeved barong to a batwing
                sleeve adds to the feeling that this world is slightly different from our own. This project has also
                taught me a lot about usage of light in art. Working on main pieces for Bruxist has made intense
                improvements to my understanding of lighting.

                    Bruxist actually derives from the word <em>bruxism</em>, which is the condition of excessive teeth
                    grinding. Bruxist itself isn't an actual word, but I added on a common suffix to make it sound like
                    it applies to a person. The “bruxist” himself is Lenen.
