                        This project was a collaboration with the EECU, which gave budgeting presentations to our class
                        just a few days before this was assigned. We were tasked with creating a budgeting site based
                        off of concepts we researched online. This was also my first time independently utilising
                        JavaScript within a site. Besides this, my classmates and I were directed to have others code
                        our site for us. During this project, I not only learnt how to communicate from a managerial
                        stance, but also acquired experience coding for others as well.

            <p>
                After completing a competitive audit on 5 sites, the thing I was trying to avoid the most was having my
                design look like how the DMV feels. I focused on having a simple user-friendly design with appropriate,
                fresh-looking colors and a business-friendly look. While my site was originally planned to be two pages,
                my understanding of JavaScript was too rudimentary to properly implement some of the features I wanted.
                I adapted my site's needs to my own capabilities as best I could, but was unable to discern how to make
                a key part of my site (chart.js) function properly.

            <br><br>

            <p>
                As I researched competitor designs for budgeting sites, I found a common color scheme. Most sites tended
                to use some combination of dark greens, blues, greys, or white. However, two sites (<a target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.voya.com/tool/budget-calculator">Voya</a> and <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/budgeting-calculator-5120904">The Balance Money</a>) had very
                unexpected palettes. The unique colorways of these sites inspired me, and I enjoyed how they appeared
                more friendly to the eye. Originally, I intended on using colours similar to Voya's choices. However, in
                the end, I recalled how a palette can truly make or break a site such as in my experience creating
                Jurassic Expeditions. I fell back on safer green/blue tones, but lightened them to be less threatening.

            <p>
                My final design remained very true to my original prototype, though I left out some features like seeing
                the change between your previous budgeting to your current. Overall, I'm somewhat proud of how it turned
                out. If I was to return to this project, I would add back in those features and make the pie chart
                functional.

                        <p>
                            This project was an overall improvement from my first interactable site, Jurassic
                            Expeditions.
                            The design of my prototype translated over almost seamlessly into code. I also learnt how to
                            properly communicate with “employees” about what I was looking for. This project may not
                            have
                            turned out perfectly, but it was nonetheless a valued learning experience for JavaScript
                            implementation and teamwork.

                            The failures of this site mostly reside within the capabilities of my JavaScript. I was
                            unable
                            to display many values correctly. I also had issues with properly styling displays at the
                            end of
                            the site as well as the labelling for the chart/s.

                Through this project, I better acquainted myself with JavaScript. Proper user interface also came to me
                more clearly as I was designing this. I believe this site was the catalyst which helped a lot of aspects
                within the coding and UX world click for me.

                    I spent an additional 4-5 days (in total) polishing the site by myself. This total span of time took
