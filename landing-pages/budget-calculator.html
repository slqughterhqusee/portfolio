                        This project was a collaboration with the EECU, which gave budgeting presentations to our class just a few days before this was assigned. We were tasked with creating a budgeting site based off of concepts we researched online. This was also my first time independently utilising JavaScript within a site. Besides this, my classmates and I were directed to have others code our site for us. During this project, I not only learnt how to communicate from a managerial stance, but also acquired experience coding for others as well.

            <p>
                After completing a competitive audit on 5 sites, the thing I was trying to avoid the most was having my design look like how the DMV feels. I focused on having a simple user-friendly design with appropriate, fresh-looking colors and a business-friendly look. While my site was originally planned to be two pages, my understanding of JavaScript was too rudimentary to properly implement some of the features I wanted. I adapted my site's needs to my own capabilities as best I could, but was unable to discern how to make a key part of my site (chart.js) function properly.
            </p>

            <h3>Colorways and Aesthetic</h3>

            <section class="row">

            </section>

            <p>
                As I researched competitor designs for budgeting sites, I found a common color scheme. Most sites tended to use some combination of dark greens, blues, greys, or white. However, two sites (<a href="https://www.voya.com/tool/budget-calculator">Voya</a> and <a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/budgeting-calculator-5120904">The Balance Money</a>) had very unexpected palettes. The unique colorways of these sites inspired me, and I enjoyed how they appeared more friendly to the eye. Originally, I intended on using colours similar to Voya's choices. However, in the end, I recalled how a palette can truly make or break a site such as in my experience creating Jurassic Expeditions. I fell back on safer green/blue tones, but lightened them to be less threatening.

            <p>
                My final design remained very true to my original prototype, though I left out some features like seeing the change between your previous budgeting to your current. Overall, I'm somewhat proud of how it turned out. If I was to return to this project, I would add back in those features and make the pie chart functional.

                    <h3>Success</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project was an overall improvement from my first interactable site, Jurassic Expeditions. The design of my prototype translated over almost seamlessly into code. I also learnt how to properly communicate with “employees” about what I was looking for. This project may not have turned out perfectly, but it was nonetheless a valued learning experience for JavaScript implementation and teamwork.

                    <h3>Failure</h3>
                    <p>
                        The failures of this site mostly reside within the capabilities of my JavaScript. I was unable to display many values correctly. I also had issues with properly styling displays at the end of the site as well as the labelling for the chart/s.

            <h3 id="budgTakeaways">Takeaways</h3>
            <p>
                Through this project, I better acquainted myself with JavaScript. Proper user interface also came to me more clearly as I was designing this. I believe this site was the catalyst which helped a lot of aspects within the coding and UX world click for me.

                    For two-three weeks this project was completely coded by classmates following either my word-for-word directions or going off my Figma prototype.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I spent an additional 4-5 days (in total) polishing the site by myself. This total span of time took place off and on over the course of 2-3 more weeks.
