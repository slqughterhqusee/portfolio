                        In this project, my class was tasked with designing and coding a functional website meant to
                        handle customer service functionality for Jurassic Park if it was a real attraction. I handled
                        this project with my partner Carl Leon, who helped with site design and HTML. The two of us were
                        also asked to collaborate with a UX team, which was creating an app. Leon and I's site was asked
                        to focus on Expeditions, a branch of Jurassic Park which handled rides and tourist attractions.

            <p>
                Originally, I had been in charge of handling the overall aesthetic design of the site. I had wanted
                it to show a clean and sleek design. Leon and I had wanted the site to be intuitive and easy to
                navigate, but the amount of repetition ended up creating a lazy look to the final product.
            </p>

            <br>


            <img class="long" src="/images/juriexpi/juri-palette.png" alt="">


            <br>

            <p>
                My own preferences for site design clashed not only with the color palette we were later
                instructed to use, but also with the UX team's designs that we were asked to collaborate with
                later. Our UX team loved the fun colours of the palette; the colours which I'd been actively
                avoiding. However, I decided to compromise and keep our formatting but change the colourway.
                With the help of Leon, our site managed to pull itself together and match with our UX team while
                not being too horrible on the eyes. I also stressed psychological color association: This site
                was intended for users to purchase from. We veered away from reds and associated clickables with
                yellow to distinguish them easier.
            </p>

            <p>
                The final site mostly reflects what was expected of it in the original prototyping. Some of the
                original flow was changed last minute because of errors in the CSS, which overall made the site seem
                stiff. While it is passable for a first large-scale site, the design and user flow needs work.

                        <p>This site taught Leon and I a lot about how to form a site meant to actually be interactive.
                            With our focus on how customers would receive the site, it taught us to include
                            accessibility features (such as information on whether some experiences are
                            disability-accessible, or remembering to avoid layering colors which fall within the same
                            spectrum of colorblindness). </p>

                        <p>Our site isn't very interesting or entertaining. We very much failed to have an intriguing,
                            characteristic design; it definitely feels elementary. Some of the contrast on the site is
                            poor, and a lot of it has slow loading time. It definitely could've been improved with some
                            variation. In addition, the Jurassic Park branding didn't show very well through our design;
                            the site felt vaguely Jurassic Park inspired, rather than themed.</p>

            <p>
                I definitely feel that Leon and I were able to pinpoint our strengths and weaknesses during this
                project. In the future, I knew I wanted to create something with a more interesting design and
                better utilise appropriate colors for what I was creating. Also, Carl and I both felt obligated to take
                up the entire screen width of the PC we were coding on, which also comprimised quality. In future
                projects, I have avoided this issue by centering everything in a way that still allows it to look good.

            <h3>Explanation</h3>

            <br>

            <p>
                Four or five months later, I've come back to this project with new experience and viewpoints of how
                an interesting and engaging site would look. I decided to prototype it with my new experience to see
                the contrast in my design from the beginning of my programming journey to the end. This production
                of this prototype is not in collaboration with Carl Leon or any members of our previously partnered
                UX designers. This revision is still currently a work in progress, so the prototype I currently have is
                still very bare bones.
            </p>

            <br><br>

            <h2 id="juriRevProto">Prototype</h2>
            <div class="landing-div"></div>
            <p>
                Honestly, my main goal while making this potential prototype for Jurassic Expeditions was for it to
                have
                no resemblance to the initial site. With this rendition, I wanted to see how far my imagination
                could
                extend past the first version of it I put into the world and give it a unique touch.
            </p>

            <section class="row-btwn-top">
                <section class="resqual">
                    <img src="/images/juriexpi/home-new.png" alt="">
                    <br><br>
                    <h4>Home</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        First, I knew that I wanted the home page to have more personality. I liked the initial header
                        style
                        that we came up with, but I felt that as a background image, the branding of Jurassic Park
                        didn't
                        really come through much. As my first step, I centered the branding without any distraction.
                        Next, I
                        made navigation a lot easier. Instead of having to jump to different parts of the page or scroll
                        through while reading a bunch of descriptions, I added links to the top which would immediately
                        take
                        you to a separate page collecting options of the topic. The rest of this page has a unique and
                        interesting flow, and it's meant to appear more like a large advertisement than an actual
                        showcasing
                        of options like our first site was.

                    <h4>Staff</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        For the staff page, I felt like the initial layout felt very rigid and unplanned. Partially
                        because
                        it was (adding our UX Designers was a last minute thing), but anyhow. Instead, the idea was to
                        have
                        it flow similar to a credits scene. Horizontal formatting can often feel easier to read through
                        in
                        small segments like these because in English, we read from left to right. I followed that logic
                        and
                        placed individual worker profiles horizontally so they're easier and less jarring to skim
                        through.

                    By the end of this project, Leon and I were dead tired. We started noticing a bunch of
                    completely useless chunks of CSS by the end from cluttered formatting, and two days before due
                    realised we'd forgotten to style an entire page. There were also a lot of issues with our
                    checkout formatting which was generally awful.
