                        creation of an entire society, culture, laws, language, and a few characters. Currently, the
                        main focus is on culture design.

                The cities of Berevi and Sul are one of many which were erected during the final years of Earth's time
                supporting the human race. After the drastic effects of climate change, many billionaires paired with
                scientists and engineers to create a new society elsewhere in the universe. Realising the opportunity
                they had with this project, they created a new language and did their best to erase what traditional
                culture they could. Through this was birthed the Sinst cities. These cities have no interaction with
                each other and are located in massive domes. Inside these cities, many different forms of society have
                developed.

            <p>
                So far, not much art has actually been developed for this project. However, the city designs have.
                Berevi is a highly cybernetically advanced city, utilising low gravity and magnetisation for inverted
                walkways, buildings, and more. Sul is a stark differenceâ€”having less resources, their city is majorly
                underdeveloped. Many of their buildings consist of fibre or rope strung over iron bars, and transfer
                between the inverted top city isn't as easy.

                        Rexhe's (pronounced <em>reh-t-jey</em>) design consists mainly of streetwear, and was the first
                        outfit I designed for this project. His outfit is meant to be eye-catching, bright, and a bit
                        mismatched. Designing this outfit was one of the first times I focused on using bright pops of
                        colour on top of a light neutral base instead of a dark one. It was also my first time willingly
                        incorporating patterns into my art, which I typically heavily avoid. These can be seen within
                        his hair and also on his arms as he ages.

                        Ghatku's (pronounced <em>gah-tsuh</em>) design relies on earthy colours and natural dyes, since
                        that's all his society has access to. His design was the first where I actually needed to
                        consider the available materials, dyes, and necessary functionality. His clothes are also all
                        lined with cinches so as to close when he accesses the inverted city. The nuances that are found
                        in outfits due to environment and available materials is very important to consider, which
                        designing for him taught me.

                        The clothes seen on Oyil are purposely meant to mismatched while having a form of cohesive
                        style. In his major design, Oyil is wearing clothes which don't belong to him. It's important to
                        consider how other character's clothes fit on him and how he manages to style it. This was an
                        important exercise for me since I had to get creative with the realities of how outfits don't
                        always perfectly fit who they're wearing.

            <p>
                So far, Myopic doesn't have an overall colorway or aesthetic as I've hardly drawn anything for it.
                However, there are stark differences between Berevi and Sul colorways which will be seen when they are
                eventually drawn. Berevi has more resources and technology, leading to more availability of brighter
                colours. Neons, greys, blacks, and other hard-to-find colours are seen more in Berevian designs (such as
                Rexhe and Oyil's). In contrast to Berevi, Sul relies mostly on natural dyes produced from food products
                and other natural resources. Sul itself is far more brown-based and less saturated overall. The more
                saturated a colour is, the darker it will get. I've learned that just these colour choices can show a
                lot about the differences in a society.

            <p>
                Ghatku's initial design was created before any world development on Sul was made. Initially, it was
                planned to be a society similar to Berevi in terms of resource availability. As development went on, it
                turned out that their fabric choices needed to be wildly different, which meant Ghatku's current outfit
                was out of the question. As I redesigned him, I wanted to adapt parts of his sharp aesthetic into his
                new outfit. Obviously, with loose fabrics, it can't directly transfer over. Instead, I utilised
                proportions and kept his top short. I also included leg wrappings and dark, saturated colours. While it
                doesn't directly reflect his initial design, I felt the overall vibe of what I'd been trying to get
                across translated nicely.

            <br>

            <p>
                This project greatly expanded my horizons on how character design and worldbuilding goes together;
                especially that outfit design is affected by the world around it. Before working on this project, I'd
                designed characters and left them unchanged, or put them in outfits which didn't match resource
                availability. Errors like this can be seen in my Allegories design of Nox. Being constrained by these
                things not only made my characters make more sense in their world, but also taught me to get creative
                with the functionality of clothing.
