                        After being requested to create a text adventure game, me and my long-term across-the-desk
                        partner James Steed decided to come together to make our jokes come to life. The plot of the
                        story had no direction besides to follow the monomyth (or hero’s journey). Naturally, we decided
                        to create a massive inside joke about our teacher and school.

            <p>
                Out of all our assigned projects so far, this one was by far the biggest and most labour-intensive. The first thing we did was create a flowchart of not only our story progression, but also how our JavaScript storage objects were going to interact. Next, we created a general interface prototype to make sure we had full clarification between us about what exactly we were coding. This was also helpful in spotting original JavaScript functionality which would've been above our level and fixing it before it became an issue. Before we even began coding, we created a shared drive which contained every asset we'd need for the game. We also kept task lists and devlogs, as well as a document with every line of dialogue we'd need.

            <h3>Contributions</h3>
            <p>
                Steed and I didn't follow an outlined plan of 'who does what'. Instead, we decided to go with a more natural approach of us individually taking charge from tasks that needed to be done at the moment. Through this process, we learnt to lean on each other's strong points. This helped us avoid blaming each other over not putting in enough effort or not doing challenging enough work; both of us had our fair share of mundane and complicated tasks.

                    <p>
                        As we began the project, I focused on helping fill holes within our storyline. This extended further to me making sure the story wasn't solely route-by-route. The functioning of our object layouts and interactions were also majorly designed by me. Most of our overall functionality is conceptualised by me, which Steed found a way to translate it into an effective function. The actual interface design was completed by me as well. Codewise, I worked mostly on the HTML and CSS. Near the end of the process, I assisted Steed with what remained on our JS to-do list.

                    <p>
                        The plot of the game was almost entirely imagined by Steed. He focused majorly on dialogue for big cutscenes and JavaScript coding. Besides this, he was also the main person who kept our task list updated and our drives organised. He assisted with leftover work needed on our HTML as our work time came to a close.

            <p>
                Steed and I wanted a simple, easy to use design. We prioritised having such simple HTML and CSS because of how JavaScript heavy the game is. Our game also heavily relied on CSS to hide and show elements quickly instead of opening separate pages.
            </p>

            <p>
                Steed and I instantly agreed on following a black-and-white analog horror design. We took direct inspiration from the Mandela Catalogue and pop-culture "analog horror" for the imagery we added onto the site. We purposely curated the images we used to appear as unsettling. We also were looking for a very basic user interface.

                My final design remained very true to my original prototype, though I left out some features like seeing
                the change between your previous budgeting to your current. Overall, I'm somewhat proud of how it turned
                out. If I was to return to this project, I would add back in those features and make the pie chart
                functional.

                    <h3>Success</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project was an overall improvement from my first interactable site, Jurassic Expeditions.
                        The design of my prototype translated over almost seamlessly into code. I also learnt how to
                        properly communicate with “employees” about what I was looking for. This project may not have
                        turned out perfectly, but it was nonetheless a valued learning experience for JavaScript
                        implementation and teamwork.

                    <h3>Failure</h3>
                    <p>
                        The failures of this site mostly reside within the capabilities of my JavaScript. I was unable
                        to display many values correctly. I also had issues with properly styling displays at the end of
                        the site as well as the labelling for the chart/s.

            <h3 id="budgTakeaways">Takeaways</h3>
            <p>
                Through this project, I better acquainted myself with JavaScript. Proper user interface also came to me
                more clearly as I was designing this. I believe this site was the catalyst which helped a lot of aspects
                within the coding and UX world click for me.

                    My interface design was actually inspired by a game I found on BoredButton in 2019, another text adventure where you wake up and go work at a hamburger shop.

                    All NPCs (save some of the ones found at the mall) are members of the various computer science classes at our educational institution. After a field trip, I walked between classrooms asking if any classmates would be interested in being an NPC in our game. I'd tell them to look at me as if they weren't in their own body, or to smile and raise their eyebrows without moving their cheeks.
