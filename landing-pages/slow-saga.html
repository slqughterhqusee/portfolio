                        After being requested to create a text adventure game, me and my long-term across-the-desk
                        partner James Steed decided to come together to make our jokes come to life. The plot of the
                        story had no direction besides to follow the monomyth (or hero's journey). Naturally, we decided
                        to create a massive inside joke about our teacher and school.

            <p>
                Out of all our assigned projects so far, this one was by far the biggest and most labour-intensive. The
                first thing we did was create a flowchart of not only our story progression, but also how our JavaScript
                storage objects were going to interact. Next, we created a general interface prototype to make sure we
                had full clarification between us about what exactly we were coding. This was also helpful in spotting
                original JavaScript functionality which would've been above our level and fixing it before it became an
                issue. Before we even began coding, we created a shared drive which contained every asset we'd need for
                the game. We also kept task lists and devlogs, as well as a document with every line of dialogue we'd
                need.

            <p>
                Steed and I didn't follow an outlined plan of 'who does what'. Instead, we decided to go with a more
                natural approach of us individually taking charge from tasks that needed to be done at the moment.
                Through this process, we learnt to lean on each other's strong points. This helped us avoid blaming each
                other over not putting in enough effort or not doing challenging enough work; both of us had our fair
                share of mundane and complicated tasks.

                    <p>
                        As we began the project, I focused on helping fill holes within our storyline. This extended
                        further to me making sure the story wasn't solely route-by-route. The functioning of our object
                        layouts and interactions were also majorly designed by me. Most of our overall functionality is
                        conceptualised by me, which Steed found a way to translate it into an effective function. The
                        actual interface design was completed by me as well. Codewise, I worked mostly on the HTML and
                        CSS. Near the end of the process, I assisted Steed with what remained on our JS to-do list.

                        The plot of the game was almost entirely imagined by Steed. He focused majorly on dialogue for
                        big cutscenes and JavaScript coding. Besides this, he was also the main person who kept our task
                        list updated and our drives organised. He assisted with leftover work needed on our HTML as our
                        work time came to a close.

            <p>
                Steed and I wanted a simple, easy to use design. We prioritised having such simple HTML and CSS because
                of how JavaScript heavy the game is. Our game also heavily relied on CSS to hide and show elements
                quickly instead of opening separate pages.

            <p>
                Steed and I instantly agreed on following a black-and-white analog horror design. We took direct
                inspiration from the Mandela Catalogue and pop-culture "analog horror" for the imagery we added onto the
                site. We purposely curated the images we used to appear as unsettling. We also were looking for a very
                basic user interface.

                The current version of The Slow Saga contains baseline functionality and all needed assets. Steed and I
                are planning to continue working on it and hopefully bring it closer to our original hope for a product.
                So far, one ending is attainable, but items for two can be collected. Money and health features still
                need to be implemented.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I am intensely proud of our interface and overall graphic quality. We also have a
                        well-functioning system for changing displays as the player moves. I'm also very proud of how we
                        were able to create organised objects and reference them so well. The fact that our game is even
                        minimally functional makes me insanely happy, because it was such an ambitious project and we
                        got the first steps for it in place.

                    <p>
                        Our NPC spawning function breaks intermittently, sometimes randomly. The second attainable
                        ending doesn't trigger when conditions are met, and we can't figure out why. Also, our NPC
                        interactive buttons don't properly rehide.

            <h3 id="sagaTakeaways">Takeaways</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Something both Steed and I realised while making this project is that we definitely needed to make more
                helper functions. Our JS is insanely repetitive in parts, and so when we continue working on the
                project, I'm going to create a proper helper function.

                    My interface design was actually inspired by a game I found on BoredButton in 2019, another text
                    adventure where you wake up and go work at a hamburger shop.

                    All NPCs (save some of the ones found at the mall) are members of the various computer science
                    classes at our educational institution. After a field trip, I walked between classrooms asking if
                    any classmates would be interested in being an NPC in our game. I'd tell them to look at me as if
                    they weren't in their own body, or to smile and raise their eyebrows without moving their cheeks.
