                    <p>
                        Currently, I've created a handful of website projects. I spend a majority of my free time
                        developing characters and worlds, which are also detailed here. Since I'm new to computer
                        science, I unfortunately don't have any relevant writing. Instead, I'd love if you could take a
                        look into my world and see my views on media, and also find more out about my stories through my
                        creative writing!
